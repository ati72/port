              Hi, I'm Attila, a Computer Science graduate who enjoys creating
              practical software solutions. I'm particularly interested in using
              technology to solve real-world problems and am always looking for
              new ways to improve my coding skills.
            </p>
            <p>
              Throughout my degree, I've become familiar with programming
              languages such as C, Python, Java, and JavaScript, database
              technologies like SQL and noSQL. I have experience in full-stack
              web development, mobile app creation, and algorithms, and enjoy
              working with frameworks like React and Spring Boot. One of my
              favorite projects was developing a card game application using
              React and Spring Boot, which helped me strengthen my understanding
              of front-end and back-end integration. I'm particularly interested
              in full-stack development, devOps and cloud computing.
            </p>
            <p>
              My hobbies include listening to music, playing the guitar,
              watching american sports(NFL, NBA), Formula-1, reading or playing
              video games. I'm always eager to learn something new, whether it's
              a programming paradigm or a fun hobby.
