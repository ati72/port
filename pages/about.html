              Hi, I'm Attila, a Computer Science graduate with a passion for
              building innovative software solutions. I'm fascinated by how
              technology can solve real-world problems, and I love exploring new
              ways to apply my coding skills to make an impact.
            </p>
            <p>
              Throughout my degree, I've developed strong skills in programming
              languages such as Python, Java, and JavaScript. I have experience
              in full-stack web development, mobile app creation, and
              algorithms, and enjoy working with frameworks like React and
              Spring Boot. One of my favorite projects was developing a
              web-based task manager using React and Node.js, which helped me
              strengthen my understanding of front-end and back-end integration.
              I also worked on a machine learning project that predicts house
              prices based on historical data. I'm particularly interested in
              full-stack development and cloud computing.
            </p>
            <p>
              My goal is to contribute to meaningful projects that improve user
              experiences and solve complex problems. I'm eager to continue
              learning and refining my skills as I enter the tech industry. When
              I'm not coding, you'll likely find me hiking, experimenting with
              new recipes, or playing video games. I'm always eager to learn
              something new, whether it's a programming language or a fun hobby.
